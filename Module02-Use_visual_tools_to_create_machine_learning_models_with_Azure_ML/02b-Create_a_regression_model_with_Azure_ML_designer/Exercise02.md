Go to preview data within the Automobile price data to review the schema of data.
![](Evidences/Image06.png)


Review the data.

Set the columns as in the image (Select Columns in Dataset).
![](Evidences/Image09.png)


Set the columns as in the image (Clean Missing Data).
![](Evidences/Image10.png)


Set the columns as in the image (Normalize Data).
![](Evidences/Image11.png)


Ensure your pipeline looks similar to the image and run the pipeline.

Add and set an Evaluate Model module to the canvas and Submit.
![](Evidences/Image17.png)


Go to evaluation results section and view the results. These include the regression performance metrics.

Create and run an inference pipeline.
Your inference pipeline predicts prices for cars based on their features.
![](Evidences/Image19.png)


Deploy a predictive service.
![](Evidences/Image20.png)


Wait until the deployment status is healthy.
![](Evidences/Image21.png)


Create a new notebook file.
![](Evidences/Image22.png)


Verify that predicted price is returned.
